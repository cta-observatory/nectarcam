Repository for the high level analysis of the NectarCAM data.
The analysis is heavily based on [ctapipe](https://github.com/cta-observatory/ctapipe), adding custom code for NectarCAM calibration.

`nectarchain` is currently pinned to `ctapipe` version 0.19.

This code is under rapid development. It is not recommended for production use unless you are an expert or developer!
