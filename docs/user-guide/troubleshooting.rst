.. _troubleshooting:

Note to macOS users
-------------------

macOS users may experience errors when trying to initialize a proxy to DIRAC when the DIRAC support is enabled :ref:`optional-dirac-support`, especially with recent hardware equipped with M1 or M2 Apple CPU chips. The container alternative can then help having an environment with CTADIRAC fully configured. However, `Apptainer <https://apptainer.org/>`_ is `not readily available on macOS <https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html#mac>`_, but there is a workaround using `lima virtualization technology <https://lima-vm.io/>`_ on a Mac.

**TL;DR**

.. code-block:: console

   $ brew install qemu lima
   $ limactl start template://apptainer
   $ limactl shell apptainer apptainer run --bind $HOME:/home/$USER.linux oras://ghcr.io/cta-observatory/nectarchain:latest


If you are running a Mac which CPU is based on ARM architecture (M1 or M2 Apple chips), when starting the ``apptainer`` container (second line above), please select the ``Open an editor to review or modify the current configuration`` option and add the following line at the beginning of the configuration file:

.. code-block:: console

   arch: "x86_64"

otherwise, if your Mac is on an Intel CPU chip, please proceed with the ``Proceed with the current configuration`` option.

The mount point ``/tmp/lima`` is shared between the host machine and the ``apptainer`` container, and writable from both.
